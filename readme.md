whattodo 
  - want to do feeling eventually, but not worrying about that now.
  - instead focusing on the day they want (and the time, to make sure no event happens provided is already past. That being said, right now focus on the day)
  - the categories for a lot are misc, just is unfortunate, basically it will be hard to match every category because so many are misc:( 
  - the matching is as such, list fro that day, category and price (all events)
  - then all events that are not that category or price range but thay day
  - cannot access all events
  - side of calendar so can switch to different days with those parameters, and also so can change the parameters (like angular, so with two way data binding) [FOR MVP NO NEED FOR THIS FEATURE, JUST BUILD THE ABOVE, THEN TRY AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO LOOK FOR DIFFERENT THINGS]
  - obvious problem is if no events for that date on that category, which happens. Can solve by offering the cascade thing. Basically events that are also on that date but may not fit your category but fit the price (because categorizing is hard)
  - because do not know which events are duplicates, and because places like cityhall list multiple entries that take place on different days but are the same as different events it would take a lot fo manage this problem. The best solution is to once get selection, parse that data to make sure they are not similiar.
