whattodo 
  - want to do feeling eventually, but not worrying about that now.
  - instead focusing on the day they want (and the time, to make sure no event happens provided is already past. That being said, right now focus on the day)
  - the categories for a lot are misc, just is unfortunate, basically it will be hard to match every category because so many are misc:( 
  - maybe can do a quick category data based on general categories:

 ["Get Cultured ["Learn ["Try New Things ["Be Merry ["Meet New People ["Laugh ["Touristy ["Jam Out ["Be a Good Person ["Party Hardy ["Investing  ["Family Channel ["Sports ["Watch a Show ["Outdoor Fun ["Geek Out , get religious, food
