-want to have machine learning language parsing
	* giving feeling based on text and match
	* match based on probablity
-delayjob /chron job
-get ip
	* around 100 don't have location. What to do then?

- algorhtim
	-need to get each distance from ip
	-top 3 by price, distance, or our rank algorithm  (ascending descending)
	-need to format time to be same everythwere
	-need to have when time not listed to be "time not availble" same with price not available
-need to do strong params/hide keys, facebook authenticate, lightbox, make algorthim work

-delayjob/chron job
-bank of categories and feelings. six randomly chosen to be displayed
-machine learning on feeling. regex matching first based on description
-results page has my rank, then can click to get price (least expensive=free, most=highest). then click to get distance (closest, farthest)
