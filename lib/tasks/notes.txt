-create facebook events on their index page for that day. only once, make sure not run twice and the event (unlike the other people), are only applicable for that user. will have to make that event for them when they log in, and delete that event when sign out.
WORKING ON NOW-might want a basic show page for each event. for example, if there is no url and you see your friend was recommended something, you have no info about it. probably good idea. like highlight on the event with your mouse and some info comes up on it
